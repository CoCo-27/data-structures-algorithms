Stacks:

    - LIFO: last in first out (like a can of pringles)
    - Can only be used for accessing the last node
        - The limited number of actions one can perform on them is a feature by design, we sometimes want to limit what the user can do on a data structure for greater control
    - Can be traversed but not really meant to be, if you need traversal this may not be the right data structures to use
    - Can be implemented using either arrays or linked lists

    Stack usage examples:
        - Browser history
        - Undo/redo buttons
        - Call stack for handling events
